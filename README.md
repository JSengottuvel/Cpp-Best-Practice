## Cpp-Best-Practice : Curated Examples

This section contains a collection of well-documented C++ code examples that demonstrate best practices in modern C++ development. Each example is designed to illustrate a specific concept or technique, such as:

- Concurrent programming with thread pools
- Concurrent programming with async, futures, and promises
- Smart pointer usage (`std::unique_ptr`, `std::shared_ptr`)
- Range-based for loops and STL algorithms
- RAII (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization)
- Proper use of `const` and references
- Move semantics and efficient resource management
- Error handling with exceptions and `std::optional`
- Writing clean, readable, and maintainable code

Explore the examples below to learn and apply C++ best practices in your own projects.
